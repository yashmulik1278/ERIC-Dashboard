# ERIC-Dashboard
Created a dashboard for retrieving triggered data from /api/status.
Did develop a drop down menu with three values: overview, performance, and errors.
The overview tab displays the machine's current condition, the performance tab displays completed tasks, and the errors tab displays failed tasks.
All of the data used is stimulated, not genuine.
follow the path given in the image to use the dashboard on your machine(check comment)
